- ⚡ Fun fact: Octopuses have three hearts! 🐙

Two of their hearts pump blood to their gills, and the third heart pumps it to the rest of their body. Interestingly, the heart that pumps to the body stops beating when the octopus swims, which is why they prefer crawling to swimming—it conserves energy!
